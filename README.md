# aoc2022 - Solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code

This repository includes my solutions for the 2022 edition of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). It is encouraged to try and solve the problems yourself before reading the solution online.

## Compilation

Compile with any modern C++ compiler. Preferably, use `-std=c++17` or newer. If you are using `clang` (or, any compiler which does not supply `<bits/stdc++.h>`) then you need to manually create the folder `bits/` and place a file called `stdc++.h` in there. The code for `stdc++.h` can be easily found online.

Good luck!.
